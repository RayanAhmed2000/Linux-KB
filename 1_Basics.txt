NETWORK
ping                (check network connectivity by sending paclets to server) | USE CASE - Check server reachability
nslookup            (fetches networking details from DNS server) | USE CASE - Check if DNS server is resolving hostname correctly
netstat             (shows network stats such as route tables) | USE CASE - check if service/application is listening properly at desired port
host                (find domain name of IP address and vice versa) | USE CASE - check IP behind hostname
arp                 (address resolution protocol || resolve IP address into  MAC address) 
traceroute          (used to get route of packet) | USE CASE - Check at which 'Hop' packet is getting dropped/missed each output row represents a Router/Hop
ifconfig            (show IP Addersses)
telnet              (telnet hostname/IP address  |  create a remote connection with a system over TCP) | USE CASE - Check if a specific port is open and accepting req
dig                 () | USE CASE - 

Combine tools: Use ping + traceroute + telnet in sequence to debug connection issues
